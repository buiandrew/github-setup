# github-setup

You will not be able to complete any labs until I've added you to the Github organization for the class, which will give you access to the class repositories.

* Sign up for a Github account, if you do not have one already. If you do have one already, associate your nyu email address with that account [here](https://github.com/settings/emails).
* Fill out the survey located here: http://goo.gl/forms/9Gs4Z7JhMa
* You will get an email from Github with an invitation to join the nyu-cso-s16 organization. Follow the instructions to accept the invitation.
    
Once you have accepted in the invitation you will be able to see the other repositories here, including lab0, which you will need to do next.
