# github-setup

You will not be able to complete any labs or participate in the recitations until I've added you to the Github organization for the class, which will give you access to the class repositories.

* Sign up for a Github account, if you do not have one already. If you do have one already, associate your nyu email address with that account [here](https://github.com/settings/emails).
* Fill out this form https://goo.gl/forms/byG66jUQE3agjHlv2
* Eventually you will get an email from Github with an invitation to join the nyu-cso-s16 organization. Follow the instructions to accept the invitation. (It may take a day or so to get the email, be on the look out and check your junk folder if you do not see if within 24 hours.)
    
Once you have accepted in the invitation you will be able to see the other repositories here, including recitation0, which you will begin during the first recitation.
